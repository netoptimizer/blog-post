* Introduction

Modern Network Interface Cards (NIC) scale by having a hardware feature,
named Receive Side Scaling (RSS), that based on a flow-hash spread incoming
traffic across the RX irq-lines, which can be handled by different CPUs.

Unfortunately there can be a number of situations where the NIC hardware RSS
features fail, which result in delivering all packets to same RX IRQ-line and
thus same CPU. This blogpost is about how to handle this situation in software,
when RSS fail.
